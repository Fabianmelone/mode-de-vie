# Mode de Vie

## Description

Welcome to Mode de Vie!
Share your passion & Unleash your creativity!
We built this project for anyone to post about their life across the platform, people can like, comment and save posts and follow their favorite users or their friends.
The rankings page will allow you to see the most liked posts and the most viewed posts, which gives the app a little bit of competition between the users.
We learned how to build an app using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side api, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database while working in a team
and using our unique skills to build one fully functional application.
Happy Posting!

Once signed up or logged in, you will be redirected to the dashboard, which shows you a random post with owner, title, and description. You can click the dashboard icon on the side to see a different post.
