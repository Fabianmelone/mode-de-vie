# Mode de Vie

## Description

Welcome to Mode de Vie!
Share your passion & Unleash your creativity!
We built this project for anyone to post about their life accross the platform, people can like, comment and save posts and follow their favourite users or their friends.
The rankings page will allow you to see the most liked posts and the most viewed posts, which gives app a little bit of competition between the users.
We learned how to build an app using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side api, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database, while working in a team
and using our unique skills to build one fully functional application.
Happy Posting!

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
